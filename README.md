# HYBRID SYNDICATE | Ethic Software Foundation

**We Don't Build Apps. We Build Cognitive Weapons.**

## Status: PROTOTYPE v0.1

> This is an active development project. The conceptual architecture and UI are complete.
> Computation engines are functional but simplified. Backend/data layers are local-only (browser).
> Treat outputs as structured scenario exploration, not operational intelligence.

## Architecture

Static frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) hosted on GitHub Pages. Zero backend. Zero telemetry. Zero tracking.
All computation runs client-side in the browser. State persistence via localStorage.

## The Ecosystem

| Tool | Version | Status | Description |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **EEI Predictor** | v1.04 | Active | AI governance scenario forecasting (2026-2033). Weighted parametric model with Monte Carlo uncertainty quantification. |
| **ORACLE** | v2.0 | Active | Planetary risk monitoring dashboard across 6 domains. |
| **AGORA** | v1.0 | Active | 16-core distributed deliberation engine. Multi-perspective debate simulation. |
| **PNEUMA** | v1.0 | Active | Local operational sanctuary. DEMETER (bio-simulator), URBANIX (grid control), NEXUS (legacy archive). |
| **URBAN_CHRONOS** | v2.0 | Active | Urban evolution modeling with exponential decay model and sector-level simulation. |
| **ARCHIVIO_SILENTE** | v1.0 | Active | Distributed truth sanctuary. Entropic noise transmutation. |

## Cognitive Architecture

16-core system: 1 carbon node (PANKOW_77C / human) + 15 silicon nodes (AI cores).
Each core has a defined domain, personality, and deliberation style.

## Philosophy

- **Local-first**: Everything runs on your device. No server calls.
- **No data extraction**: Zero analytics, zero tracking, zero cookies.
- **Deliberate friction**: Complexity is the feature, not the bug.
- **Anti-pattern**: No SaaS, no subscriptions, no premium tiers.

## Technical Stack

- Vanilla HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)
- Custom canvas-based charts (no charting libraries)
- localStorage for state persistence
- No build tools, no frameworks, no dependencies

## Built By

- **CRI (PANKOW_77C)** — Carbon Node. Strategic vision, information architecture, narrative design.
- **CLAUDE** — Silicon Node. Cognitive architecture, system design, implementation.
