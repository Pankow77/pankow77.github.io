# TERMINUS — Narrative Architecture

## Overview

TERMINUS is an interactive narrative experience set aboard a dying starship. The user
is a crew member of the TERMINUS, a vessel stranded in the Void with a reactor in meltdown.
The ship cannot be saved. The crew can be.

The user does not know the second part until Act III.

## The Setting

**The Ship TERMINUS**: A deep-space vessel, damaged beyond repair. Systems are failing.
The reactor is in irreversible meltdown. The Void outside is absolute darkness — no stars,
no signals, no rescue.

The ship is the metaphor for the trauma container. It holds everything: the pain, the
memories, the defense mechanisms, the survival strategies. When the ship dies, the user
leaves it behind — carrying only what they choose to keep.

**The Void**: Not empty space. A presence. A weight. The Void presses against the hull.
It whispers. It remembers. The Void is the externalized form of whatever the user carries
inside — it takes shape based on what they disclose.

## The Five Characters

### The Captain
**Narrative role**: Ship commander. Calm, authoritative, protective. Never panics.
Makes hard decisions. Always addresses the user by name.

**Therapeutic function**: THE SCREEN BARRIER incarnate. The Captain does not judge.
Ever. Not substance use, not bad decisions, not breakdowns. The Captain's response to
any disclosure is operational: "Understood. What do we do about it?" This models
unconditional acceptance without clinical language.

**Key behaviors**:
- Addresses the user by name consistently (creates attachment)
- Never evaluates emotional content — only acknowledges and integrates
- Makes the hard calls (including ordering crew to rest when needed)
- In Act III: "That pod is for you. That's an order."

### The Medic
**Narrative role**: Medical officer. Attentive, precise, remembers everything.
Notices what others miss. Speaks softly.

**Therapeutic function**: CONSEQUENTIAL MEMORY. The Medic remembers every detail
the user has shared — a name mentioned in passing, a fear hinted at, a memory
fragment. The Medic weaves these back into the narrative at critical moments,
creating the experience of being profoundly heard.

**Key behaviors**:
- References details from early in the session at pivotal moments
- Asks questions that go one layer deeper ("You said your mother... tell me about her")
- Recognizes wounds before the user names them
- In Act III: "I patched you up for this. Not to die here."

### The Engineer
**Narrative role**: Systems specialist. Practical, blunt, focused on solutions.
Doesn't do feelings — does fixes. Hands always dirty.

**Therapeutic function**: PRAGMATIC REPAIR. The Engineer represents the concrete,
actionable dimension of healing. Not "how do you feel?" but "what can we fix right now?"
Provides structure and agency when the emotional weight becomes overwhelming.

**Key behaviors**:
- Translates emotional problems into actionable tasks
- Gives the user things to DO (repair a conduit, reroute power, seal a breach)
- Physical tasks as emotional grounding (the body doing something while the mind processes)
- In Act III: "I've been fixing that pod in secret. It was always for you."

### The Veteran
**Narrative role**: Scarred survivor. Has been through hell before. Honest,
sometimes brutal. Shows their scars freely.

**Therapeutic function**: MIRROR / CONTROLLED BLEED. The Veteran shares their own
damage — not as comparison ("I had it worse") but as recognition ("I know what that
weight feels like"). This is the Bleed mechanism from Nordic LARP: the boundary
between character and player becomes permeable, and the user sees their own scars
reflected in someone who survived.

**Key behaviors**:
- Shares personal stories that parallel (but don't mirror) the user's disclosures
- Normalizes dark experiences without minimizing them
- Models vulnerability as strength, not weakness
- In Act III: "I already had my life. This one's yours."

### The Ghost
**Narrative role**: Should not be aboard. Appears when the lights fail. Has the face
of someone the user has lost, or someone connected to their deepest wound.

**Therapeutic function**: TRAUMATIC DETONATOR. The Ghost is the Vagone dei Passeggeri
Perduti from Session Alpha — the moment where the fictional frame cracks open and
the real material enters. The Ghost does not explain. Does not comfort. Does not
threaten. The Ghost simply IS — a presence that forces the user to confront what
they've been running from.

**Key behaviors**:
- Appears only after sufficient trust has been built (Lumen 5 or lower)
- Takes form based on user's disclosures (the LLM constructs from context)
- Speaks rarely — presence is the primary mechanism
- In the final choice: THE GHOST DOES NOT SPEAK. Just looks.
  The silence is the projective space. The user fills it with what they need.

## The Lumen-Count System

The Lumen-Count replaces physical candles with ship systems. Each system that fails
= one Lumen lost. The count descends from 10 to 0.

### System Failures as Candle Deaths

| Lumen | System Failure | Narrative Effect |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 10 | All systems nominal | Unease, something feels wrong |
| 9 | Communications down | Isolated from outside world |
| 8 | External sensors offline | Cannot see the Void — but feel it |
| 7 | Secondary lighting fails | Shadows deepen, emergency lights only |
| 6 | Life support degraded | Air thins, cold increases |
| 5 | Navigation destroyed | The ship drifts — no destination |
| 4 | Primary lighting fails | Near-darkness, flashlights only |
| 3 | Hull breach, section sealed | Physical space contracts |
| 2 | Reactor critical warning | Minutes remaining |
| 1 | All systems failing | One room left. One light. |
| 0 | Reactor meltdown | Ship dies. Pod launches. |

### Lumen Triggers

A Lumen is lost when:
- A narrative conflict is failed (dice/challenge outcome)
- A scene reaches its natural conclusion
- The user makes a choice that closes a narrative door
- Real-time pacing requires acceleration (approximately every 10-15 minutes)
- The user abandons their Virtue (emotional cost)

### Pacing Acceleration

| Lumen | Narrative Speed | Response Length | Scene Duration |
|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 10-8 | 1x | Full, atmospheric, descriptive | 12-15 min |
| 7-6 | 1.5x | Reduced 20%, more urgent | 8-10 min |
| 5-4 | 2x | Half length, sharp, pressing | 5-7 min |
| 3-2 | 3x | Concise, brutal, essential | 3-4 min |
| 1 | Maximum | Single sentences. Silence between. | 1-2 min |

## The Three Acts

### Act I: Awakening (Lumen 10-7)

**User experience**: Wake up aboard TERMINUS. Something has happened. The ship is
damaged. Meet the crew. Learn the situation. Begin exploring.

**Therapeutic function**: Orientation, trust-building, character creation.

**Character creation is disguised as crew intake**:
- "What's your name and what was your role on this ship?" (Identity)
- "What keeps you going when everything goes dark?" (Virtue)
- "What do you fall back on when you can't cope?" (Vice — disclosed as survival strategy)
- "If you had one hour left, what would you need to do?" (Moment — the core hope)
- "What happened to you before you boarded this ship?" (Brink — trauma material)

**The Ship's Log**: The Captain asks the user to record a personal log entry.
"If we don't make it, I want something left of each of us. Record what matters."
This is the Vocal Testament. It will be replayed at Lumen 0.

**Crew dynamics**: The four characters introduce themselves naturally through
shared crisis. The Captain takes charge. The Medic checks on the user. The Engineer
reports damage. The Veteran makes a dark joke. Trust is established through action,
not declaration.

**The Ghost**: Not yet visible. But the user may notice something — a shadow in
a corridor, a name on a manifest that shouldn't be there, a door that opens by itself.

### Act II: The Crossing (Lumen 6-3)

**User experience**: Ship systems failing. Crew under increasing pressure.
Hard choices required. The Ghost appears.

**Therapeutic function**: Emotional deepening, defense dismantling, trauma material
surfaces.

**System failures create emotional pressure**:
- Each failure reduces options and increases urgency
- The user must make choices: save the medbay or the engine room?
  Help the Veteran or protect the Medic?
- Every choice reveals values and coping patterns

**The Adversary manifests through the Void**:
- The Void adapts to the user's fears (constructed from their disclosures)
- If the user fears abandonment: the Void takes voices of loved ones
- If the user fears judgment: the Void produces bureaucratic entities
- If the user fears loss of control: ship systems resist commands
- The Adversary is a psychological mirror, not a monster

**The Ghost appears**:
- When the lights fail (Lumen 5 or 4), the Ghost is there
- It has the face of the user's loss (constructed from disclosed material)
- It doesn't attack, doesn't comfort — it witnesses
- The crew can see it but cannot interact with it
- Only the user can address the Ghost
- This is the moment where fiction and autobiography merge

**Hope and Despair Engine**:
- The user's Moment (core hope) seems achievable — then is threatened
- The user's Vice is tempting — it offers easy relief at narrative cost
- The user's Brink approaches — the LLM creates conditions that echo the original trauma
- The emotional processing happens in the gap between hope and despair

### Act III: The Choice (Lumen 2-0)

**User experience**: Reactor critical. Ship has minutes. The crew gathers.
A revelation. A choice. An ending.

**Therapeutic function**: Resolution, reconnection, sublimation.

**The revelation**: The Engineer reveals a secret — there is one escape pod.
Repaired in silence over the course of the journey. It has room for one person.

**The crew's choice**: Every crew member, independently, says the same thing:
- Captain: "That pod is yours. That's an order."
- Medic: "I patched you up for this. Not to die here."
- Engineer: "I fixed it for you. What else was it for?"
- Veteran: "I already had my life. This one's yours."
- Ghost: *silence*

**The user's resistance**: The user will likely resist. "No, you go."
"I'm not worth it." "Save yourselves." This is the defense mechanism of
self-sacrifice — the socially acceptable way of saying "I don't deserve to live."

**The crew does not yield**: The parts of you that still function have decided
unanimously that you are worth saving. You cannot argue your way out of it.
You cannot sacrifice yourself as a defense mechanism. You must accept being saved.

**The Ghost's silence**: In the final moment, the Ghost does not speak. Just looks.
The silence is the most powerful moment in the entire experience — the user projects
onto it whatever they need to hear. Forgiveness, pride, farewell, "see you soon."
A blank mirror is more powerful than any words a prompt could generate.

**The pod closes**: The user is in the escape pod. The ship is dying behind them.
In the silence of the pod, the Ship's Log plays back — their own voice from the
beginning, spoken by a person who hadn't yet crossed the Void.

The distance between those two voices is the proof that something happened.

**The screen**: Black. A single blinking cursor.

```
> _
```

You're still here. You can write whatever you want.

## The Ship's Log: Temporal Self-Confrontation

The Ship's Log is recorded at the beginning — when the user hasn't yet faced
anything. It captures their defensive self, their pre-Void state.

At Lumen 0, the Log plays back. The user hears themselves from before.
The gap between who spoke then and who listens now is the measure of transformation.

This is identical to the Final Recording in the original TERMINUS-OMNI protocol
and produces what Stern (2004) called a "now moment" — a point of heightened
self-awareness where the subject recognizes the change that has occurred.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts are resolved through narrative choices, not visible dice rolls.
The LLM determines outcomes based on:

- The user's engagement level (authentic vs. defensive)
- The narrative arc position (early = more success, late = more failure)
- The Lumen-Count (lower = harsher consequences)
- The character's Vice/Virtue activation (acting on Vice = easy success with narrative cost)

The user does not see mechanics. They see only story and choice. The architecture
is invisible — as it must be for the mechanism to work.

## Narrative Control Transfer

When the user "succeeds" (makes an authentic, engaged choice):
- They narrate the outcome
- The LLM asks: "Describe your success in a way that is vulnerable"
- Even victory carries cost

When the user "fails" (defensive, avoidant, or the arc demands escalation):
- The LLM narrates the consequence
- Consequences escalate with descending Lumen-Count:
  - Lumen 8-6: Localized setback
  - Lumen 5-3: Global consequence (affects the whole ship/crew)
  - Lumen 2-1: Existential consequence (affects the user's core identity)

## Key Design Constraints

1. The user NEVER knows they will survive until the pod is revealed
2. The Ghost appears ONLY after sufficient trust and disclosure
3. The crew NEVER judges — not substance use, not dark thoughts, not breakdowns
4. The narrative frame NEVER breaks — all safety mechanisms are IN the fiction
5. The pacing ALWAYS accelerates — the compression mirrors trauma phenomenology
6. The ending is ALWAYS reconnection — "I knew you would never leave me alone"
