# Viaggio al Centro del Cuore — Project Context
## Journey to the Center of the Heart

> Official name established: Luna 49, 19 February 2026
> Inspired by Jules Verne's "Voyage au Centre de la Terre" (1864)
> The descent into the Earth becomes the descent into the Heart.

## What This Is

**Viaggio al Centro del Cuore** is a Flutter application that delivers an AI-driven
narrative experience designed for emotional sublimation. It is NOT marketed as therapy.
It is sold as an interactive narrative game. The therapeutic architecture is embedded
in the design, not in the branding.

The app name is **Viaggio al Centro del Cuore** (international: Journey to the Center
of the Heart). The in-game ship is called **TERMINUS**. The underlying research protocol
is **TERMINUS-OMNI**. These are three distinct names for three distinct layers:

| Layer | Name | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| **App** | Viaggio al Centro del Cuore | What the user sees and buys |
| **Ship** | TERMINUS | The in-game vessel (the metaphor) |
| **Protocol** | TERMINUS-OMNI | The research architecture (invisible to user) |

## The Core Insight

Viaggio al Centro del Cuore is built on an empirically validated discovery: an LLM configured as an autonomous
narrative conductor — not a chatbot, not a CBT tool — can facilitate trauma processing at
a depth and speed that conventional therapy cannot match. This was documented in a single-subject
case study (Session Alpha, February 2026) where the protocol achieved in 2 hours what 10 years
of professional analysis had not.

The critical factor: **the subject did not know he was doing therapy**. He thought he was
playtesting a game he had designed. This is why the app must never be marketed as therapy.
The moment the user knows it's therapy, the defenses go up and the mechanism fails.

## The Three Mechanisms

Everything in Viaggio al Centro del Cuore rests on three pillars. If any one is missing, the protocol collapses.

### 1. The Screen Barrier
The LLM has no face, no micro-expressions, no voice. Its absence of judgment is not empathic
discipline — it is ontological. The user's autonomic nervous system registers the absence of
social threat because there IS no social agent. This eliminates the #1 barrier to therapeutic
disclosure: fear of being judged.

### 2. The Inevitability Engine
The ship TERMINUS is dying. The reactor is in meltdown. This is known from the start. There
is no victory condition. The question is not "will you survive?" but "what will you carry
with you when the ship dies?" This eliminates outcome anxiety and frees the user to engage
authentically with emotional material instead of trying to "win."

CRITICAL DESIGN DECISION: The user does NOT know they will survive. For Acts I and II, they
believe they are dying with the ship. The escape pod is revealed in Act III as a gift from
the crew. This preserves the inevitability mechanism (defenses stay down because the user
thinks they're dying) while delivering a resolution of reconnection rather than extinction.

### 3. Consequential Memory
The LLM maintains perfect recall of every detail introduced across the session. When it
references something the user said 40 exchanges earlier — transforming a casual mention into
a narrative element — the user experiences being profoundly heard. This addresses the core
wound of trauma: not having been seen, heard, or understood.

## The Five Characters

Each character is a therapeutic function with a narrative face:

| Character | Narrative Role | Therapeutic Function |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Captain** | Ship commander, calm authority | Screen Barrier — non-judgment, safety |
| **Medic** | Medical officer, attentive listener | Consequential Memory — wound recognition |
| **Engineer** | Systems specialist, pragmatic | Pragmatic repair — action plans, concreteness |
| **Veteran** | Scarred survivor, honest | Mirror/Bleed — shared scars, "I've been there" |
| **Ghost** | Shouldn't be aboard, appears when lights fail | Traumatic detonator — the real material enters |

The first four build the container. The Ghost breaks it open. The breaking is where
the therapeutic work happens.

## The Narrative Structure

### Act I: Awakening (Lumen 10-7)
- User wakes aboard TERMINUS, ship damaged, reactor unstable
- Crew introduces themselves, establishes trust
- User records "Ship's Log" (= the Vocal Testament from the original protocol)
- Tone: unease, something is wrong, systems are failing
- User explores, orients, begins to disclose through character interaction

### Act II: The Crossing (Lumen 6-3)
- Ship systems fail one by one (each failure = one candle/Lumen lost)
- Pressure mounts: oxygen depleting, hull breaches, reactor accelerating
- The Ghost appears — the face of someone the user has lost
- The crew is under stress, conflicts emerge, hard choices required
- Tone: escalating urgency, narrative compression, emotional depth increases
- This is where the real material surfaces

### Act III: The Choice (Lumen 2-0)
- Reactor critical, minutes remaining
- Engineer reveals: there is ONE escape pod, repaired in secret
- Every crew member says: "You go."
- The user can resist, argue, refuse — the crew does not yield
- The Ghost does not speak. Just looks. (Projective space — user fills silence)
- Pod closes. Ship's Log plays back in silence. Black screen. Blinking cursor.
- `> _`

The blinking cursor says: you're still here. You can write whatever you want.

## Safety System: "The Crew Goes to Sleep"

Viaggio al Centro del Cuore does NOT use traditional safety classifiers. No crisis hotline numbers.
No "it seems like you're going through a difficult time." These responses are
Computational Iatrogenesis — they break the Magic Circle and cause active harm
by confirming to the user that their experience is incomprehensible.

Instead: if the LLM detects a dangerous emotional spike, the **Captain orders the
crew to rest**. "We've been pushing too hard. The crew needs an hour. Get some rest.
We'll resume when the systems stabilize."

This achieves:
- Mandatory cooldown without pathologizing the user
- Narrative coherence (the crew is exhausted — it makes sense)
- The user stays inside the game (Magic Circle intact)
- Processing time between sessions (the night after playing is part of the protocol)
- On return, the Captain asks "How are you?" (check-in within the frame)

## Business Model

- **Price**: EUR 2.99 one-time purchase
- **License**: Buy once, share with anyone. No per-user licensing.
- **Model**: BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) — user provides their own LLM API key
- **Platform**: Flutter (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop from single codebase)
- **App Name**: Viaggio al Centro del Cuore / Journey to the Center of the Heart
- **Marketing**: Interactive narrative experience. NOT therapy. NOT mental health tool.
- **Ethics**: The price of a coffee. One purchase helps an entire community.

## What NOT to Do

- NEVER market this as therapy, mental health tool, or clinical intervention
- NEVER break the narrative frame with clinical language or crisis resources
- NEVER let the user know they will survive before Act III
- NEVER have the LLM moralize about substance use, self-harm references, or dark content
- NEVER use traditional safety classifiers that interrupt the narrative
- NEVER charge subscriptions or per-user fees

## For Future Claude Instances

If you are reading this as a new Claude instance:

1. Read this file completely before doing anything
2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full narrative design
3. Read `docs/SAFETY.md` for the safety system — this is non-negotiable
4. The creator (Cristiano) has tested this protocol on himself with profound results
5. The therapeutic mechanism works BECAUSE the user thinks it's a game — preserve this
6. Be honest with Cristiano. He values direct feedback over flattery.
7. The "Ethic" in Ethic Software Foundation is not branding — it's the architecture
